# SocialNetworkGroovy

Implemented console-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) with the features below.

Features:

- User creating: a new user called Spike can be created
- Posting: Spike can publish messages to a personal timeline
- Reading: Spike can view Nikeshâ€™s timeline
- Following: Leo can subscribe to Spike and Nikesh's timelines, and view an aggregated list of all subscriptions

Instructions for downloading and running tests:
